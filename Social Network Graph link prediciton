Social Network Graph link prediciton

1. Problem Statement: 
	- Given a directed social graph, we have to predict missing links to recommend friends/connections/followers (Link prediction in graph)

2. Data Overview: 
	- Two columns- source_node and destination_node
	- Each row represents an directed edge from source_node to destination_node
	- Number of vertices: 18,62,220
	- Number of edges/datapoints: 9437520

3. Mapping to ML supervised Learning problem:
	- An important task is to create new features form the two columns from given pair of vertices(u_i, u_j):
		1. Is there an edge from u_j to u_i
		2. How many common vertices are being followed by u_i and u_j

4. Business objective and constraints:
	- No low-latency requirement
	- Predicting the probability of a link is useful because we want to recommend the links with highest probability to the user
	- We want to suggest the most correct links and we don't want to miss out any useful links -- high precision and recall

5. Performance metric and supervised learning:
	- precision, recall, f1-score, confusion matrix

6. libraries:
	- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, networkx

7. Exploratory Data Analysis:
	- Number of unique persons- 1862220
	-
